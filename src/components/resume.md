- Established and led a five-member web development team, mentoring new hires while successfully managing 5 concurrent projects and overseeing recruitment efforts (screening, interviewing, onboarding).

- Architected scalable web infrastructure (Docker, AWS ECR, Lambda, CloudFront, API Gateway, Terraform), defining tech stack, tooling, coding standards, and DevOps processes. This enabled the deployment of Next.js micro-frontends, handling 500k+ traffic surges with sub-100ms global load times.
- Built a modular Tailwind framework (w/ Shadcn, Framer Motion, Matter.js, GSAP) to rapidly create visually dynamic landing pages, cutting development time from days to hours.
- Rapidly prototyped experimental solutions under 1-2 day deadlines, accelerating the company's path to initial revenue.
- Proactively built a custom Tailwind-based headless component library (predating ShadCN). Progressively iterated over UI frameworks (Ant Design, SCSS, Bootstrap, Chakra UI, Tailwind) to enhance UI development toolkit.

- Built scalable frontend with high/low-level design, using modular components, hooks, and contexts. Optimized data-flow with React Query & Zustand.
- Engineered a feature-rich, real-time chat application (direct & group) using Socket.IO, supporting 5000+ daily messages with media and sticker capabilities.
- Collaborated on a React Native design platform, developing cross-platform components to enable dynamic, backend-driven UIs (via JSON schema) for web and mobile.
- Developed an in-house push notification system enabling precise targeting based on SQL queries and Mixpanel data. This solution replaced MoEngage, cutting costs by 2-3 lakhs annually and keeping the data within the company.
